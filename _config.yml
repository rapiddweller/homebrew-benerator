# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  A powerful software solution for data generation, obfuscation, and migration for development, testing, and training purposes. Our core goals are to provide model-driven test data generation that satisfies complex data validity requirements, anonymize production data for showcases and serious performance testing projects, efficiently generate large data volumes, and offer wide customizability and ease of use for non-developers.
